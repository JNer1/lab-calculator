# Lab Calculator

We all had that time in the lab where forgot how to compute how much agar to put or what amount of antibiotic to add for stock solutions.
Other times, it can just be out of laziness.

Lab calculator is here to make that as easy as possible, so now all you have to worry about is contamination instead of computation.
